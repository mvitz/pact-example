# Pact Example

**[Pact](https://docs.pact.io) examples for the JVM using [Pact JVM](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm)**

These examples were written for my german
[JavaSPEKTRUM](http://www.javaspektrum.de/) article
"Der Praktiker: Pacta sunt servanda - Consumer-Driven Contracts â€“ Testen von Schnittstellen innerhalb einer Microservices-Architektur".

You can read it online
[here](https://www.innoq.com/de/articles/2016/09/consumer-driven-contracts/)
or download as PDF
[here](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/uploads/tx_dmjournals/vitz_JS_04_16_TaTZ.pdf).


## Run the Example

* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `consumer` subdirectory.
* Note that JSON Pact files were created in `consumer/target/PACTS`
* Run `mvn integration-test` in the `provider` subdirecty.
* Note that this test uses the JSON Pact files in `pact-example/provider/src/test/resources/pacts`.

So to change the contract the consumer team would change the tests in `consumer/src/test`. This
would result in different Pact files. The consumer team would provide them to the provider team.
That way the Pact file would be integrated in the `provider` project. The provider team needs to
assure that the tests pass.


## Pact Broker

This branch shows how to use the [Pact Broker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker).
Please follow the steps below before executing `mvn clean install`.

```
git clone https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker
docker-machine create --virtualbox-memory "4096" --driver virtualbox pact
eval $(docker-machine env pact)
docker-compose -f pact_broker-docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
